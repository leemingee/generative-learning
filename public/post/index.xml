 Why this blog?  Sharing is nice. Especially for the techs stuff.

      <description>Recently I’ve been thinking about what car to buy. Searching the web is one way, but I wanted to do it in a more “data” way, so in this series I’ll show how I’ve extracted data about ~19.000 used cars in Berlin to find out what models/manufacturers seem to hold the price for longer.
In my case I’ve decided to use this as an excuse to practice some of the skills that I’ve been dying to try for a long time - web scrapping with R.</description>
