<p>Another R meetup, another talk about tidyverse. This time I’ve talked about <code>purrr</code>. I really like this package, but I do have a feeling that I didn’t present in the best light possible. I certainly could have prepared a couple more examples that showcase why this package is so awesome and what kind of workflow it allows to create. To pat myself on the back a bit, it was a good idea to anticipate that it would take a bit longer than I’ve planned and to put “interesting” parts of <code>purrr</code> first. We didn’t have time to go over utilities in <code>purrr</code>, but I do believe that they are quite self-explanatory, so hopefully no issues with them.</p>
<p>R markdown format of the presentation is <a href="https://github.com/romatik/touring_the_tidyverse/blob/master/3_purrr.Rmd">here</a>, code I’ve used during presentation is <a href="https://github.com/romatik/touring_the_tidyverse/tree/master/purrr">here</a>.</p>
