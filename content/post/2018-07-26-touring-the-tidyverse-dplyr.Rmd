On 25th of July, 2018, I've given a talk with the topic "Touring the tidyverse: dplyr". It was a second installment of the series of talks about `tidyverse`. R markdown format of the presentation is [here](https://github.com/romatik/touring_the_tidyverse/blob/master/2_dplyr.Rmd), code I've used during presentation is [here](https://github.com/romatik/touring_the_tidyverse/tree/master/dplyr). Over time I'm planning to cover most of the packages in `tidyverse`. Let me know if anything is not clear about this talk or any other in the series.

All talks in the series:

1. `tidyr` - https://www.mishabalyasin.com/2018/05/27/touring-the-tidyverse-tidyr/
1. `dplyr` - https://www.mishabalyasin.com/2018/07/26/touring-the-tidyverse-dplyr/
1. `purrr` - https://www.mishabalyasin.com/2018/10/24/touring-the-tidyverse-purrr/
1. `tidyeval` - https://www.mishabalyasin.com/2018/11/30/touring-the-tidyverse-tidyeval/
