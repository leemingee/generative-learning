Keep this blog as the queue-style log of the todos. As I hope I can get some time for myself from the beginning of March 2019, so I list the things here and keep track of them.

Summary:     
C++ Lint is really nice.    
Till 3/17/2019 morning, I have spent 68 hours in GTA5, which is a really charming and thoughtful process while I m playing it. The three characters, F, M, and T are built really solid and impressive. A good game, honest speaking, better than AC(may be comparable to the Ezio Series) regarding to the story line and characters built.
