<p>Continuing what I’ve started already with the post about <a href="https://www.mishabalyasin.com/2017/07/23/blogdown-netlify/">blogdown</a> where I’ve advertised how easy it is to use <code>blogdown</code> for all you blogging needs, today I want to do the same about <code>Docker</code>. If you don’t know what <code>Docker</code> is, there is a <a href="https://sec.ch9.ms/ch9/27c6/eb231ad1-bc19-4465-b731-98d10e4827c6/AutomaticallyArchiving_mid.mp4">video</a> from <a href="https://user2017.brussels/">useR!2017</a> that started the process for me and where <a href="https://github.com/nuest">Daniel Nust</a> explains what it is and why you should care.</p>
<p>But more specifically, for hands-on <a href="http://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/">tutorial</a> I went with <a href="https://ropensci.org/">ROpenSci</a> tutorial. Overall, it is quite good, but I did come across couple of things I wanted others to avoid so if you are thinking about following the tutorial, here is a very short list of things I’ve noticed to be a little bit off in the tutorial:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I’ve experienced some weird hangs while running the docker images. I’m fairly certain it has little to do with the actual image, but the only way to unhang is <code>docker kill &lt;container_id&gt;</code> and then restart the image with <code>sudo docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -v /home/misha/R/projects/rocker-tutorial:/home/rstudio/rocker-tutorial verse_gapminder</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>docker login</code> no longer needs/accepts email. Putting just your username is enough for it to ask your password. You can also add your password to <code>login</code>, but it’ll be in plain text, so maybe not a great idea.</p></li>
<li><p>Tutorial is making a refence at multiple points to a file with location <code>data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv</code>. I guess I’ve missed the point where it was created, so I didn’t have it. Specifically, when I’ve got to the part with <code>ADD</code> in <code>Dockerfile</code> I’ve came across the problem that since I don’t have that file I wasn’t able to add it into the build process. On the bright side, I was forced to look into the docker build process a bit more and came across this <a href="http://kimh.github.io/blog/en/docker/gotchas-in-writing-dockerfile-en/">blog</a> where author talks about <code>context</code>. In short, everything in the same folder as <code>Dockerfile</code> will be added to it’s context. That means that using <code>ADD file.txt</code> will only succeed if <code>file.txt</code> is inside the same folder as <code>Dockerfile</code>. So, I’ve just copied one file to the same folder and used <code>ADD script.r /home/rstudio/</code> and then used <code>sudo docker build -t my-r-image .</code> successfuly.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Other than that I didn’t have any issues with following the tutorial and after following it, <code>Docker</code> definitely is less daunting than it used to be.</p>
