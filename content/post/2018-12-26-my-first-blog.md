This is my first blog, so here I draft something to keep myself reminded of. Those things are:

- Why this blog?

Sharing is nice. Especially for the techs stuff.

- What I want to share?
  - The tech things I m interested, the cool things I learned about, studying and working on, and want to explore in the future.
  - The outdoor activities I m enjoying. Skateboarding and hiking.
