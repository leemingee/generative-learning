Another stop on the journey through the `tidyverse` and this time it's one of the most interesting and mysterious corners (I think) of the entire suite of `tidyverse` packages - tidy evaluation. My goal for the talk was to introduce [ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nERXS3ssntw) behind tidy evaluation in an interactive manner. To do that, I've used mostly exactly the same approach as Lionel Henry (main contributor to `rlang` that hosts tidy evaluation) outlined in this WIP book creatively called ["Tidy evaluation"](https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org/).

As usual, R markdown format of the presentation is [here](https://github.com/romatik/touring_the_tidyverse/blob/master/4_tidyeval.Rmd), code I've used during presentation is [here](https://github.com/romatik/touring_the_tidyverse/tree/master/tideval).
