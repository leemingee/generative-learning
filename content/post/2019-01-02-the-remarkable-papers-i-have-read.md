The remarkable Papers I have read

The initial intent to write this blog is to sorting out the paper I read in 2018. As the AI area is changing and new techs are coming up every minute, so I want myself to keep up to date of the remarkable papers. Stay hungry, stay foolish.

The papers mainly can be divided in several eras: utils of Data science, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, deep learning. And each can be divided into more specific era. If you are a recruiter, happy to be asked about them or discuss about them.
